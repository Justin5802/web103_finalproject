## About

Muze is a web app created for CodePath's WEB103 Final Project. It is a comprehensive web app that allows users to create playlists of their own and share them.

### Description and Purpose

This web app allows users to generate playlists of their own and share them. Users can choose songs out of a database, ranked by genre or artist, personalize it, and then create it. If a user is feeling curious, they can click a generate playlist button in whatever genre they desire, and a playlist will be generated for them. A user can then save their created playlist to their own list, or share them. 

### Inspiration

This web app is inspired by Spotify, a web application with an intuitive interface that helps manage users' songs, create playlists, and share them with friends. 

## Tech Stack

This web app is created using

Frontend: React

Backend: Express, NodeJS, Railway

### [Feature 3: User Playlist Generation]

[When users are indecisive or are unsure of what songs they would like to add to their playlist, the app should have a feature that automatically generates a playlist for them based upon their preferences. Users can either take a short quiz about their personal music preferences, or choose a specific genre, and a playlist will be automatically generated for them based on their responses or selected genre.]

### [Stretch Feature: Playlist Sharing]

[This feature will allow users to share their personal platforms on various social platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter/X. After saving or generating a playlist, the user should see a prompt to share their playlist on social media, in which upon clicking said option, a post would be generated sharing the playlist and urging viewers to create their own playlist with a link to the website/app.]

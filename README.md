## About

The Music Playlist App is a web app created for CodePath's WEB103 Final Project. It is a comprehensive web app that allows users to create playlists of their own and share them.

### Description and Purpose

This web app allows users to generate playlists of their own and share them. Users can choose songs out of a database, ranked by genre or artist, personalize it, and then create it. If a user is feeling curious, they can click a generate playlist button in whatever genre they desire, and a playlist will be generated for them. A user can then save their created playlist to their own list, or share them.

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[We were able to work on some of the issues that we ran into developing our application. For this unit, we primarily focused on rounding out the front end and back end so we can fully plan out the features we planned to implement. We were very successful for the most part, including the design from our Figma prototype, as well as our initial designs that we created for Muze during its inception. ]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[For the front-end, we were successful in implementing everything we needed to get started. For instance, we were able to create a very simple user authentication program using ProtectedRoute and Guards in React.js. This is to protect our application by letting users only view certain windows of the app only after creating an account. However, we ran into a problem with the backend, where we were unable to pull from the Spotify Web API, which we planned to use for our music library and playlists feature. To counter this, we are planning on putting pictures of albums as placeholders for users to choose from when manually creating their playlist until we are able to implement this feature. Thankfully, this is the only issue we ran into so far, and our frontend is nearly complete.]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[We nearly finished all of our tasks in the sprint plan for this week. The only thing we did not solve is connecting our API to the backend, but we plan to hopefully solve this issue by next week, and definitely before our project deadline. This is our top prioritized issue as without it, we cannot implement the features we would like to in this application.]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[The way we planned out our features and user stories, we definitely have a backup plan should our ideas to implement various tasks in the front- and back-end do not go as planned. As described above, for example, we have placeholders for music in case we are unable to pull the requested data from Spotify's web API.]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[Since the front-end is nearly done, and the back-end has been finished setting up, the only thing we would need to work on is figuring out how to pull from Spotify;s web API so we can use their data for the features in our application. We can turn to CodePath's very helpful Tech Fellows to get us started if we continue to run into trouble. Overall, in spite of being busy this week, we were able to accomplish more than expected when working on our final project during this unit.]

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In this unit, we found a web app idea for our final project. We collaborated and created some user stories of potential people who would find a need for our app idea, and listed features to break down what the web app should do for its users.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

This group was formed last minute, as our previous partners had left the course and a replacement partner was offered late. As a result, our brianstorming process was not as thorough as expected and work took longer than usual. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need to do research and more brainstorming on how to implement the features we thought about.

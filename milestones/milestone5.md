## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[We were able to complete the front-end for the project, including adding views for playlist generation and a user's own playlist. In addition, we were also able to create front-end pages for the surveys that users can take to have a playlist automatically generated. We were able to implement some of the backend as well. While our project wasn't able to be completed or deployed, we are proud that we were able to get a substantial part of it done, given the circumstances.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[Unfortunately, circumstances outside our control meant that our project wasn't completed to its fullest potential. Despite this, we are extremely proud of the work we were still able to accomplish, and what we were able to build has provided a great foundation for a fantastic web application one day.]

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

[I am proud that we were able to complete as much of the project that we did, given the challenging circumstances we faced.]

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

[Learning how to deploy an app, as well as getting a hands-on experience on what it is like to build an app from near scratch, proved to be an exciting new experience for us. Learning to pitch our ideas to other people was also a thing I wasn't expecting to experience in this course, but will likely to prove valuable in our careers. Since the beginning of the course, I knew how to develop a website, but since this course, I have learned nearly the full extent of full-stack advanced web development, from connecting a database, developing RESTful APIs, and deploying our apps. This journey has made me more confident in my ability to be a capable software engineer, and made me more ready to tackle additional internships and careers in my field.]

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

[My goals are to develop a website or application that can help connect others around the world. What we built is one of the first important steps in achieving this, and I hope that one day, we can achieve building an application that is beneficial and people will love using. Even Muze in its incomplete form has potential, and I am grateful for the hard work that was put into this project.]

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[Being able to discuss various project ideas and ways to implement our features. We were able to come up with a plan by creating a project board and assigning various tasks for us to accomplish]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[Unfortunately, I was busy with schoolwork, projects, and interviews so we weren't able to work on the project as much as we would have liked. However, now that we have a project board, as well as various features and steps that we know that we need to implement and accomplish, we are hopeful that we can make significant project on our project in the coming weeks.]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[We did not finish all of our tasks, but we already have planned our tasks and steps to implement these features using the various techniques we learned in class. As a result, we know what to prioritize and what we need to accomplish to complete our project.]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[Since we have a limited time to complete this project, we feel that using Spotify's Web API can do a lot of the "heavy lifting", so to speak. Since it is unlikely we can create our own playlists or databases in time, our plan is to integrate the Spotify API into our project such that users can gain access to the vast majority of music on Spotify's database, as well as create their playlists on Spotify's platform. Our goal for this application is to ease the process with the help of Spotify's API. As such, the only user stories and features that may be at risk is the user sharing feature, although we have already designated that as a stretch feature and don't prioritize it as high as the other features we have planned. We also think our plan to use the Spotify API will make user sharing easier if these items are considered "at risk".]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

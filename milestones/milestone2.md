## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[We were able to further define and complete our features list, while delving further into deciding what our app will do and its functionality. We were able to develop wireframes for nearly six of the webpages for our web app, which will give us a better idea of what to work on and how it will look once we begin programming and developing the application. In addition, we created our entity relationship diagram to better represent the large database we will be utilizing for our music library, as well as the possible APIs we will be working with. We also were able to present a short slide-show and a presentation for our pitch of our application. Overall, progress has been going very well during this unit. ]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[We didn't really face many challenges in this unit. Our progress was a lot smoother and easier now that we have gotten into a good workflow. Last week, we were hindered by last minute challenges, but this unit was overall much smoother and easier.]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[Now that we have a prototype, wireframes, diagram, and presentation completed, we have a much better idea of what to work on and how our app will likely look like in its final iteration. We will likely need some support from some of the CodePath staff in ensuring that we can program and develop this application to its fullest potential, but now that the foundations are in place, we are more confident we can accomplish this than last week.]
